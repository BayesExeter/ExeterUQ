# ExeterUQ

**ExeterUQ** is an open repository developed by researchers at the University of Exeter for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) primarily in R and RStan (the Stan interface for R). **ExeterUQ** possesses a number of key and unique features such as 

1. Bayesian GP emulation for a single model output or multivariate outputs (time-series, spatial fields)
2. Calibration via history matching
3. Multi-wave history matching (refocussing)

In order to link up to the repository you can use one of two different ways, either using Terminal or RStudio.
